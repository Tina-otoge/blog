This is a blog where I, Tina, write about the stuffs I want to. It can be about
anything.

Since I'm a young IT student using my free time to play Japanese
[rhythm games][rhythm-games] and code random stuffs, this blog is mostly about
programming and Japanese games.

This blog is powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) & [coffee][coffee-code].
