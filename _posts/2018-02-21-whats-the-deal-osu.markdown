*osu!* is a rhythm game that brings the gameplay of *osu! Tatake Ouendan*,
*Taiko no Tatsujin*, *EZ2Catch* and VSRGs to the PC platform.

It is a free game which receives content from its users rather than from a core
staff team.

But if you hang out in any general rhythm games community, you will see *osu!*
is often treated as a bad game, a game to avoid in general.

The first rhythm games I played seriously was probably *DJ Hero* and *Band Hero*
for the Nintendo Wii console. Being games made for an audience mainly composed
of casual gamers by an american company, my main interest was in the playlist.
For someone like me who had no special interest in music at that time, it had a
lots of musics I knew even for someone like me who was a total neophyte.

Even though playing musics I know might have been an important part in my
enjoyment of the game, I'm quite sure playing on a dedicated controller also
influenced me a lot without noticing it.

Years later someone introduced me to *osu!*, being told it was "a rhythm game I
will like because there's a lots of music from every music genres and you can
also add your own". Which is true. And I played the game from mid-2014 to the
end of 2015 and then lost interest.

# Why did I lost interest in osu!?

The more I played *osu!*, the more I discovered songs I like. And the more I
discovered songs I like, the more I wanted to know about from where they come
from. That's how I discovered some doujin circles like IOSYS and HARDCORE
TANO\*C, which I still listen to today. That's also how I discovered BEMANI
games and especially *SOUND VOLTEX*.

For a long time I was convinced there was no way to play those games without
going to amusement centers in Japan. I made the conclusion that *osu!* was the
best option for me, to play at home on a PC with a keyboard.

After expressing my interest in those games, a friend told me "Hey why don't
you go to that arcade center in Paris, they have *beatmania IIDX 22: PENDUAL*.
So I went there. And played *IIDX* every week. Actually at least twice a week.
(I spent a lot of my money there). And it felt nice. It felt so nice that I got
myself a *IIDX* controller from gamo2 the following Christmas.

At this point I already lost most of my interest in *osu!*. I could play a
rhythm game at home, in arcade-like conditions. But most importantly I could
play musics from their original source. I played a game with musics that were
made for this game. That may not sound like an important point to some of you
but trust me it is. It creates an huge gap in quality and feeling when you
compare it to an amateur game that just imports musics from other sources like
*osu!* or *stepmania*.

Another important point for me was the way the game rewarded me. In *osu!* the
main motivation factor comes from the pp ranking system, in which a player is
ranked by earning points regarding their performances on songs they clear.
A high accuracy + high combo clear is a good clear. In most BEMANI games,
the player is rewarded simply by clearing songs. Of course an higher accuracy
means a higher score. But if you want to get to the "highest rank" you have to
clear specific songs, independently of your accuracy. And getting to the
"highest rank" is the primary goal of most players (including myself). That
boosted my motivation to play those games more than *osu!* did.

Clearing hard songs became my first goal and doing high scores became my
secondary goal.

# So what, it's just about the scoring / ranking?

Of course not. I think for me the biggest turn down with *osu!* is the feeling.
When I play *osu!* it feels like I play a non-legitimate game. It's just a
"fan-game" that copies the gameplay from a Nintendo DS game and copies the
songs from a lot of games or other illegal sources (copyrighted songs).

As **peppy told me in a discussion we had**, one of his main purposes with
*osu!* always had been to be able to play "any songs". I can of course
understand this. The fact is that the game doesn't encourage original content.
Only importing from other sources. I would have no problem with it if *osu!*
only supported contents made for the game, and left to the users the option to
play "illegal" songs (by sharing .osz files on websites not supported by the
official one for example). This is the model found in *BMS*.

I also understand that most people don't care about this. But it strongly
matters to me. When playing I often tell myself "I'm not playing this song the
way it was intended to be played. This song was made for another game, to be
played in other conditions".

I think that's one of the main reasons *osu!* is disrespected by other
rhythm games players. Players that play other games feel like they are the one
playing the "true" games while *osu!* is a cluster of adaptations. And I am
not only talking about the gameplay but also about the songs you play.

Another very big point would be the quality of gameplay. And by that I means
the charting (called *mapping* in *osu!*) quality, the way you interact with
the game (the inputs) and the way your are rewarded (the score).
That's something very hard to explain with only words. That's something I
immediately felt after I tried to play *osu!* again after trying *beatmania
IIDX* at the arcade in Paris. Basically it's the feeling that in *osu!* the
only difficulty is the speed while in other games, the chart challenges you
more by using more sophisticated combinations of notes which don't need to be
faster than more regular patterns to be more difficult. It's actually very hard
to describe this so you will have to believe me on this point if you never
tried anything else than *osu!*. Other games just feel more well-made.
I think the fact that other games benefits from musics made specially for them,
while *osu!* mappers tries to "translate" the feeling of the song to the
gameplay of *osu!*, songs that were made for other purposes than being played
in *osu!* plays a big role in this quality.

# So osu! is just inferior to other games and that's it?

![osu! as a trash]( {{ "i/osu-as-a-trash.png" | relative_url }})

I still don't think that *osu!* has to be treated as a trash game that is just
worst than other rhythm games. It has a lot of potential and *osu!* is partly
responsible for what I am today. It introduced me to a lot of artists and games
I would have never know and that defines what I am today. It also gave me new
friends and people I still talk to regularly today.

I probably would have never been addicted to arcade rhythm games if my friend
never introduced me to *osu!*. I can't tell people to not play *osu!*. But at
the same time I can't enjoy playing *osu!* anymore and I would love to
introduce my friends to those other rhythm games I play like *beatmania IIDX*
and *SOUND VOLTEX*. However they don't see in them the same interest I have
because they didn't have the experience I had with *osu!*.

*osu!* isn't a bad game. It is very unique considering there is no other games
with this gameplay on the PC platform. It also introduces *Taiko no Tatsujin*,
*EZ2catch* and VSRG gameplay to a lot of people. Gameplays they would have
probably never know of without getting to an amusement center in Japan or
Korea.

Is *osu!* worst as a rhythm games than other games? Probably. But: *osu!* is
more accessible, it's free, it's for PC, it has a gigantic playlist. *osu!* has
online multiplayer, ranking, forums, a very big player base all around the
world. None of ther other rhythm games have all of this at once.

I'm glad *osu!* exists and I hope it will progress in a good way, promoting
original contents more and provide more ways to let people enjoy the game in
any way they want.

To all *osu!* players out there: If by any chance you have the possibility to
try other rhythm games, please do. That doesn't mean you will have to quit
*osu!*. You can actually do both. But if you like *osu!*, it's very likely
that you will like other rhythm games, especially Japanese ones.

Also to all of you that are like I was 3 years ago and are convinced you have
to go to Japan to play other rhythm games. You are wrong. There are probably
a community of arcade players in your region, most likely a very small one.
Don't expect to find as many *SOUND VOLTEX* players as *osu!* ones, there's
maybe only 30 of them in your country. Maybe one lives near you and participate
to events where they bring their controllers and game. Go there. Try the game.
Get in touch with the owner of the controller. Ask him if you can meet more
often. Get better at the game. Makes your own opinion of the game. Decide if
you want to buy or build your own controller too. Have fun trying new things.

To all non-*osu!* players out there: Stop insulting *osu!* players or the game
itself just because it's *osu!*. There are actually a lot of points you can
criticize. The scoring system. The ranking system. The staff behavior. The
top rankers behavior. But don't forget that it's only your own opinion and if
there are that much players enjoying the game, there's a reason.
